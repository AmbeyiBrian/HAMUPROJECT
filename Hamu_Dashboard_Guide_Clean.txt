HAMU WATER DASHBOARD GUIDE

Introduction
===========

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Hamu Water dashboard system, designed to help business stakeholders understand the various dashboards, charts, and performance indicators available in the system. The dashboard is designed to provide real-time insights into sales, finances, inventory, and customer behavior to support data-driven decision making.

Main Dashboard Overview
======================

The main dashboard provides a high-level overview of the business performance across key metrics. It serves as the central hub for monitoring daily operations and identifying trends that require attention.

Key Metrics Cards
----------------

Total Revenue
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This card displays the total revenue generated from all sales transactions, including both bottle sales and water refills. The value is presented in KES (Kenya Shillings) and includes a percentage change indicator comparing the current period with the previous period. An upward green arrow indicates increased revenue, while a downward red arrow shows a decrease.

Business Significance: This is the primary indicator of overall business performance and growth. Monitoring this metric helps in assessing the effectiveness of sales strategies and promotional activities.

Total Sales
~~~~~~~~~~
This metric shows the total number of sale transactions processed during the selected time period. It combines both the count of bottle sales and water refills. The card also displays a percentage change indicator comparing the current period with the previous one.

Business Significance: This metric helps track sales volume independently of revenue, giving insights into transaction frequency and customer traffic. A growing number of transactions generally indicates successful customer acquisition or increased purchase frequency.

Active Customers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This card shows the number of customers who have made at least one purchase during the selected time period. The percentage change indicator compares the current number of active customers with the previous period.

Business Significance: This metric is essential for monitoring customer engagement and retention. A healthy business should maintain or grow its active customer base. A declining number might indicate customer churn that requires immediate attention.

Low Stock Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This card displays the number of inventory items that are currently below their designated threshold value. Each stock item in the database has its own customizable threshold and reorder point values, which are used by the system to determine when an item is considered "low stock." The percentage change indicates how this number has changed compared to the previous period.

Business Significance: This metric provides an early warning system for potential stock-outs. A high or increasing number of low stock items may indicate supply chain issues that need addressing to prevent lost sales opportunities.

Dashboard Charts
---------------

Revenue Trend
~~~~~~~~~~~
This line chart displays the daily revenue trend over the selected time period. The chart visualizes patterns in sales performance, helping identify peak sales days, seasonal trends, or unusual fluctuations.

Business Significance: Trend analysis helps in forecasting future sales, identifying seasonality patterns, and evaluating the impact of marketing campaigns or external factors on revenue.

Revenue by Shop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This bar chart compares the revenue generated by each shop location. Each bar represents a shop, with the height indicating the total revenue generated during the selected time period.

Business Significance: This visualization helps identify the best and worst performing shops, allowing for targeted interventions or reallocation of resources to optimize overall business performance.

Sales by Payment Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This pie chart illustrates the distribution of sales across different payment methods: MPESA (mobile money), Cash, and Credit. Each segment is color-coded and shows the proportion of total sales made through each payment method.

Business Significance: Understanding payment preferences helps optimize cash flow management and informs decisions about which payment options to promote or expand.

Top Customers
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This table shows the top 5 customers by total spending. For each customer, it displays their name, phone number, total amount spent, and number of refills.

Business Significance: Identifying and recognizing top customers is crucial for targeted retention strategies and loyalty programs. These customers represent a significant portion of revenue and their satisfaction should be prioritized.

Sales Analytics Dashboard
========================

The Sales Analytics dashboard provides detailed insights into sales performance, allowing business stakeholders to analyze sales patterns, product performance, and payment trends.

Sales Key Metrics
----------------

Total Revenue
~~~~~~~~~~~
Similar to the main dashboard, this card shows the total revenue from all sales during the selected period with a percentage change indicator.

Refill Revenue
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This card specifically shows revenue generated from water refill services. It includes a percentage change indicator comparing the current period with the previous one.

Business Significance: This metric helps track the performance of the refill service, which is often a recurring revenue stream and indicator of customer retention.

Bottle Sales Revenue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This card displays revenue from the sale of water bottles. It includes a percentage change indicator for performance comparison.

Business Significance: Bottle sales often represent new customer acquisition and are important for expanding the customer base who will potentially use refill services later.

Total Sales Count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This card shows the total number of sales transactions and includes a percentage change indicator.

Business Significance: This metric helps in understanding sales volume trends independently of revenue, which can reveal changes in average transaction size or pricing effectiveness.

Financial Analytics Dashboard
============================

The Financial Analytics dashboard provides comprehensive insights into the business's financial health, tracking revenue streams, expenses, profitability, and cash flow metrics. This dashboard helps stakeholders monitor financial performance, identify trends, and make data-driven financial decisions.

Key Metrics Cards
----------------

Total Revenue
~~~~~~~~~~~
This card displays the total revenue generated across all business operations during the selected time period. It includes a percentage change indicator comparing the current period to the previous one, with green indicating growth and red showing decline.

Business Significance: This metric serves as a primary indicator of business growth and the overall financial health of the company. It helps in assessing the effectiveness of pricing strategies, sales initiatives, and market expansion efforts.

Gross Profit
~~~~~~~~~~
This card shows the profit after subtracting direct costs from the total revenue. It includes a percentage change indicator comparing with the previous period. In the Hamu system, Gross Profit is calculated using the assumption that 30% of total expenses are direct costs, which are then subtracted from total revenue.

Business Significance: Gross profit is a critical measure of the business's core profitability before accounting for operating expenses. Monitoring this metric helps identify whether product pricing and direct cost management are effective.

Total Expenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This metric shows all operational costs incurred during the selected period, including inventory purchases, salaries, utilities, rent, and other overhead expenses. The card includes a percentage change indicator showing expense trend compared to the previous period.

Business Significance: Monitoring expenses is crucial for maintaining profitability. Rising expenses without corresponding revenue growth can signal operational inefficiencies or cost management issues that require immediate attention.

Profit Margin
~~~~~~~~~~~
This card shows the profit margin as a percentage (net profit divided by revenue), indicating how efficiently the business converts revenue into profit. The card includes a percentage change indicator comparing with the previous period.

Business Significance: Profit margin is a key efficiency metric that helps identify whether the business is maintaining healthy margins despite fluctuations in sales volume or expenses.

This dashboard includes metrics on low stock items, inventory turnover, consumption trends, and stock movements. It helps prevent stockouts while minimizing excess inventory.

All inventory analytics explicitly use the threshold and reorder_point values defined in the database for each stock item. When inventory levels fall below the threshold value, items appear in the Low Stock Items list. When they fall below the reorder_point value, the system indicates they need to be restocked immediately. These values can be customized for each item in the stock management section.

Visual components include status indicators for inventory levels, charts showing consumption patterns, and tables listing items requiring attention.
